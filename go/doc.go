/*

mlpack is a fast, flexible machine learning library, written in C++, that aims to provide fast, extensible implementations of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms. 
mlpack provides these algorithms as simple command-line programs, Go bindings, and C++ classes which can then be integrated into larger-scale machine learning solutions.
You may also need to set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH on most Linux systems.

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/go/src/Yashwants19/v1/go
